# Test: A

This is a WebGL game using the babylon.js webgl library. Run it on a web server and open index.html in your browser to play.

Use W and D to turn left and right. Spacebar will stall the engine into a free fall. Carrot can be played without ever stalling the engine once you get good enough.

Coding of the game is basically complete, which is my main interest, so development is halted. Only the map "Carrot" is finished. The second map "Sloop" is incomplete - Making maps that are fun is difficult and time consuming. I don't make the maps. My wife does the Blender (modeling, texturing, animation, etc). If we complete another map I will add it.

Use the code as you like, for whatever purpose you want.
